<h2>Project Reflection</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>With this piece, I wanted the listener to realize the stark contrast between different environments in our society. Like starting with bad news, I chose to present the urban environment first. This way, the comfort of the listener in the natural environment is emphasized. When examining the picture of my full audioscape, one can see that the first half is a lot busier. The sounds in the first part are louder and more common. The second half of my project looks much more cleaned up, in terms of audio. These sounds have lower decibal peaks and smoother transitions, better emulating a serene outdoor environment. These basic design choices contributed to the overall mood of the piece throughout.</p>
