<h2>Soundscape Narrative for ENGCMP0610 (Composing Digital Media)</h2>
<h4>By: Zane Kissel</h4>

<h3>Urban vs Nature (Final)</h3>

<p>This soundscape narrative embodies the two juxtaposing themes of urban and natural environments through specially recorded audio and manipulation thereof. Everybody who has been to the city knows that it's hard to find a quiet place in the midst of the concrete monoliths and sputtering exhaust pipes. The first half of this soundscape captures that fast-paced, unwelcoming environment that billions of people navigate daily. The soundscape then shifts to depict a more natural atmosphere, contrasting the hectic start. The soothing sounds of the outdoors create a calming environment, one more inviting than an urban setting. The goal of this piece is to instill in the listener a newfound appreciation for our natural environment, and to encourage discourse that challenges urbanization.</p>
